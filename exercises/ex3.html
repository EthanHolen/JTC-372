          <p>
            A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
            these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I
            am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was
            created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
            friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
            existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
            drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I
            never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley
            teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper
            surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray
            gleams steal into the inner sanctuary,
